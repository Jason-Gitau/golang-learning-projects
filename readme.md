# 1-Month Go Learning Path

## Is 1 Month Realistic?

Yes, absolutely! Go is one of the fastest languages to become productive in. In **1 month of focused learning** (2–3 hours/day), you can:

- ✅ Build production-ready APIs  
- ✅ Understand concurrency (goroutines/channels)  
- ✅ Deploy real applications  
- ✅ Start contributing to projects  

You won't be an expert, but you'll be job-ready for junior/mid-level Go positions.

- 📚 [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) – FREE, excellent  
- **OR** *Go Programming Language* by Donovan & Kernighan (if you prefer books)

#### Day 6–7: Practice
- [Exercism Go Track](https://exercism.org/tracks/go) – Coding exercises with mentorship  
- LeetCode / HackerRank – Do 5–10 easy problems in Go  

### Project: CLI Tool  
Build a command-line tool (choose one):
- Todo list manager with file persistence  
- File organizer (sorts files by extension)  
- GitHub repo stats fetcher (uses GitHub API)  
- Password generator with various options  

### Key Concepts to Master

---

## Week 2: Web Development & APIs (Days 8–14)

### Learning Materials

#### Day 8–10: HTTP & Web Basics
- 📖 [*Let’s Go* by Alex Edwards](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) – Paid ($30), but **BEST** for web dev  
- **FREE alternative**: [Go Web Examples](https://gowebexamples.com/)  
- Official [`net/http` docs](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)

#### Day 11–14: Frameworks & Databases
- [Gin Framework Tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin)  
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/docs/) – ORM library  
- [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/) – Alternative to GORM (more performant)

### Project: REST API  
Build a **Task Management API** with:
- ✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete tasks)  
- ✅ PostgreSQL / SQLite database  
- ✅ JWT authentication  
- ✅ Input validation  
- ✅ RESTful routing  
- ✅ Error handling middleware  

### Framework Options
- **Gin** – Most popular, fastest to learn  
- **Fiber** – Express.js-like, very fast  
- **Echo** – Simple, good docs  
- **Chi** – Minimalist, standard library-focused

## Week 3: Concurrency & Advanced Patterns (Days 15–21)

### Learning Materials

#### Day 15–17: Goroutines & Channels
- 📺 [“Concurrency in Go” talk by Rob Pike (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cN_DpYBzKso) – ~1 hour, foundational  
- 📚 *Concurrency in Go* by Katherine Cox-Buday – Comprehensive book

- Worker pools  
- Fan-out / Fan-in patterns  
- `select` statements  

### Project: Choose One

#### Option A: Concurrent Web Scraper
- Scrapes multiple websites concurrently  
- Uses worker pools to limit concurrent requests  
- Saves results to database  
- Has rate limiting  

#### Option B: Simple Agent Orchestrator (more relevant to your goals)
- Manages multiple concurrent "agents" (goroutines)  
- Each agent can handle user requests  
- Tool system where agents can call external APIs  
- Message queue for agent communication  
- Uses channels for coordination

- [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) – Style guide  
- [Go Code Review Comments](https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments)  
- **Logging**: Use `slog` (standard library) or `zap` / `zerolog`  
- **Configuration**: Use `viper` or environment variables  

#### Day 25–30: Build & Deploy
- [Docker with Go](https://docs.docker.com/language/golang/)  
- **Deploy to**: Railway, Render, Fly.io, or DigitalOcean  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for Go  

### Capstone Project: AI Agent API Platform  
Build a mini platform for AI agents with:

#### Features
- 🔐 User authentication (JWT)  
- 🤖 Create/manage multiple AI agents per user  
- 💬 Chat with agents (streaming responses)  
- 🔧 Tool system (agents can call external APIs)  
- ⚡ Concurrent: Handle multiple users chatting with agents simultaneously  
- 📊 Usage tracking (requests per user, rate limiting)  
- 🗄 PostgreSQL for persistence  
- 🚀 WebSocket support for real-time chat  

#### Tech Stack
- Gin / Fiber for API  
- Goroutines for concurrent agent handling  
- Channels for agent communication  
- PostgreSQL + GORM / sqlc  
- OpenAI / Anthropic SDK for actual AI  
- Docker for deployment
