5. ✓ State Management
   - Thread-safe with RWMutex
   - Agent states: idle, busy, error
   - Real-time state tracking

6. ✓ Context & Timeouts
   - Request-level timeouts (default: 30s)
   - Graceful cancellation
   - Context propagation

7. ✓ Graceful Shutdown
   - Signal handling (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
   - Context cancellation
   - WaitGroup coordination
   - Clean resource cleanup

8. ✓ Statistics & Monitoring
   - Total/successful/failed requests

     replace, split, contains, word_count
   - Character/word statistics
   - Find and replace
   - String manipulation

API ENDPOINTS
-------------

  - GET  /                    - Service information
  - GET  /health              - Health check

Requests:
  - POST /api/v1/request      - Submit request to agent pool

Agents:
  - GET  /api/v1/agents       - List all agents
  - GET  /api/v1/agents/:id   - Get specific agent info

Tools:

Statistics:
  - GET  /api/v1/stats        - System statistics

GO CONCURRENCY PATTERNS DEMONSTRATED
-------------------------------------
1. Goroutine Pools - Worker pattern with N concurrent agents
2. Channel Communication - Buffered and unbuffered channels
3. Select Statements - Multiplexing channel operations
4. Context Usage - Cancellation and timeout propagation
5. Mutex Patterns - RWMutex for thread-safe state
6. WaitGroup - Coordinating goroutine lifecycle
7. Fan-Out/Fan-In - Request distribution and response collection
8. Graceful Shutdown - Clean termination of concurrent processes

LEARNING VALUE
--------------
This project is ideal for learning:
  ✓ Go concurrency fundamentals
  ✓ Channel-based communication
  ✓ Context and cancellation
  ✓ Thread-safe programming
  ✓ Interface design
  ✓ HTTP API development
  ✓ System architecture
  ✓ Production patterns

EXTENSION IDEAS
---------------
1. Add more tools (database, file operations, HTTP requests)
2. Implement request prioritization
3. Add circuit breaker pattern
4. Implement request retry with exponential backoff
5. Add Prometheus metrics
6. Implement distributed tracing
7. Add request authentication
8. Create web dashboard for monitoring
