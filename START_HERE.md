## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\Jason\Golang_lessons\week1-file-organizer

# See what would happen (dry run)
./file-organizer.exe -source test_files -dry-run

# Actually organize files
./file-organizer.exe -source test_files

# Show help
./file-organizer.exe -help
```

## 📚 Reading Order

### To Understand the Code:

1. Read `main.go` - Understand the overall flow
2. Read `organizer/organizer.go` - Core logic with detailed comments
3. Read `organizer/config.go` - JSON handling
4. Read `utils/fileutils.go` - File operations
5. Review `README.md` - Full context

### To Learn Concepts:

1. **Structs & Methods** → `organizer/organizer.go` lines 1-30
2. **Error Handling** → `organizer/organizer.go` lines 50-80
3. **Slices & Maps** → `organizer/organizer.go` lines 90-120
4. **Pointers** → Throughout, especially methods with `*FileOrganizer`
5. **File I/O** → `utils/fileutils.go`
6. **JSON** → `organizer/config.go`
7. **CLI Flags** → `main.go` lines 18-35

## 🎓 Week 1 Concepts Covered

| Concept | Example | File |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Structs** | `type FileOrganizer struct` | organizer/organizer.go |
| **Methods** | `func (fo *FileOrganizer)` | organizer/organizer.go |
| **Functions** | `func NewFileOrganizer()` | organizer/organizer.go |
| **Pointers** | `*FileOrganizer` | all files |
| **Maps** | `map[string]string` | organizer/organizer.go |
| **Slices** | `[]string`, `append()` | utils/fileutils.go |
| **Errors** | `if err != nil` | all files |
| **File I/O** | `os.ReadDir`, `os.Stat` | utils/fileutils.go |
| **JSON** | `json.Unmarshal` | organizer/config.go |
| **CLI Flags** | `flag.String` | main.go |

## 💡 Key Learnings

By building this project, you've learned:

✅ How Go structures projects (packages)
✅ Error handling Go's way
✅ Working with file systems
✅ Creating and using structs
✅ Writing methods on types
✅ Understanding pointers
✅ JSON serialization
✅ CLI development

## 🧪 Testing the Project

```bash
# Build
go build -o file-organizer.exe

# Test scenarios
./file-organizer.exe -list                          # List mappings
./file-organizer.exe -source test_files -dry-run    # Preview
./file-organizer.exe -source test_files             # Actually organize
./file-organizer.exe -create-config -config c.json  # Create config
./file-organizer.exe -help                          # Show help
```

## 🔧 Making Changes

### Add a new file extension:

1. Open `organizer/organizer.go`
2. Find `NewFileOrganizer()` function
3. Add: `".newext": "FolderName",`
4. Rebuild: `go build -o file-organizer.exe`

### Add a new feature:

1. Create a new function in the appropriate file
2. Add comments explaining the code
3. Test it with the CLI
4. Update README.md if needed
