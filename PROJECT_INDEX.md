## 🚀 Tips for Success

1. **Read the Code** - Start with `main.go`, understand the flow
2. **Try Modifying** - Change values, rebuild, see what happens
3. **Experiment** - Create new test files and try different scenarios
4. **Document** - Comment your code as you write it
5. **Test Thoroughly** - Try edge cases and error conditions
6. **Review Patterns** - Look for recurring patterns in the code
7. **Move Forward** - Don't get stuck on one concept; return later
