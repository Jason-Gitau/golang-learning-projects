└── README.md                 # Comprehensive documentation
```

**Total Code:** ~650 lines of well-commented Go code

## 🔑 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Structs & Methods
```go
type FileOrganizer struct {
    SourceDir      string
    OutputDir      string
    ExtensionMap   map[string]string
    DryRun         bool
}

func (fo *FileOrganizer) Organize() error { ... }
```
**Learning:** How to group related data and attach behavior

### 2. Error Handling
```go
if err := fo.validateSourceDir(); err != nil {
    return err
}
return fmt.Errorf("failed to move file: %w", err)
```
**Learning:** Go's error handling pattern - return errors as values

### 3. Slices & Maps
```go
// Maps for organizing files by extension
ExtensionMap := map[string]string{
    ".txt": "Documents",
    ".jpg": "Images",
}

// Slices for collecting results
var files []string
files = append(files, filename)
```
**Learning:** When to use slices vs maps, how to iterate them

### 4. Pointers
```go
func NewFileOrganizer(...) *FileOrganizer { ... }
func (fo *FileOrganizer) processFile(...) { ... }
```
**Learning:** Pointer receivers vs value receivers, efficiency

### 5. File I/O
```go
files, err := os.ReadDir(fo.SourceDir)
info, err := os.Stat(path)
os.Rename(sourcePath, destPath)
```
**Learning:** Working with file system using os and filepath packages

### 6. JSON Marshaling
```go
json.Unmarshal(data, &config)
json.MarshalIndent(config, "", "  ")
```
**Learning:** Converting between Go structs and JSON

### 7. CLI Flags
```go
sourceDir := flag.String("source", "", "Source directory...")
flag.Parse()
```
**Learning:** Building user-friendly command-line tools

## 🚀 How to Use the Project

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the project
cd C:\Users\Jason\Golang_lessons\week1-file-organizer

# Dry run (preview without changes)
./file-organizer.exe -source test_files -dry-run

# Organize files
./file-organizer.exe -source test_files

# Show help
./file-organizer.exe -help

# List all mappings
./file-organizer.exe -list

# Create config
